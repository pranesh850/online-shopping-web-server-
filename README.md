# Shopping Frontend (Static React)

This is a ready-to-use React frontend scaffold (static, no backend calls).
## How to use
1. Unzip the archive.
2. Open the folder in VS Code.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the dev server (http://localhost:3000).

Pages included:
- Home (product list) — uses mock data
- Product details
- Cart (static operations in browser)
- Login / Register (static pages)
- Navbar

Built for simple testing and UI work. Connect to your backend later by replacing mock services.
